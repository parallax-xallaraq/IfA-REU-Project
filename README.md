## Abstract 
Active galactic nuclei emit energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Using only one wavelength region to identify AGNs may miss sources with unique characteristics. In this work, we compare the multiwavelength properties of X-ray and (MIR) selected AGN in the COSMOS field. Our X-ray-selected AGN sample includes all sources with a $0.5-10 keV$ X-ray luminosity greater than $10^{43}$ $erg$ $s^{-1}$. We define our MIR-selected AGN sample using the four Spitzer/IRAC channels. We find that both selection methods miss a significant fraction of AGNs that are identified using the competing method. X-ray AGN selection is able to capture the most diverse range of multiwavelength emission properties, but misses a fraction of heavily obscured AGNs. Meanwhile, MIR AGN selection is generally biased towards more powerful, dusty AGNs.
